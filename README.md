# rine.house

A personal website by and for Adam Rinehouse, hosted [here](http://rine.house).

The site was made with simple HTML and CSS, with some JavaScript and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) for animations. Everything was completely homemade, including the custom hamburger menu and page scrolling mechanisms.

I also used [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/) for promisifying some of the animations to make sure things executed in the right order.

If you have any questions or comments on the site, feel free to reach out!
