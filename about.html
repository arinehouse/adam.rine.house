          <h2>Hi there!</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Adam Rinehouse, an amateur composer and aspiring programmer
            extraordinaire. I'm in my third year at Dartmouth College, where
            I'm fortunate enough to study both of my passions: computer science
            and music. If you're looking for me in person, your best bet's the
            DALI Lab.

          <h2>The DALI Lab</h2>
          <p>
            The Digital Arts, Leadership, and Innovation Lab at Dartmouth brings
            together teams of designers and developers to take on real-world
            projects. Much of the work I've done here has been in Unity, which I
            am now using to create a new course curriculum in Game Design.
            Recently, I became a member of the lab's core team, for which I meet
            directly with developers as an advisor and mentor.

          <p>
            From the moment I got to Dartmouth, I was ready to audition for the
            Dartmouth College Wind Ensemble. Since joining as a percussionist,
            I've tackled some of the most challenging music in the literature,
            from John Mackey's <em>Wine Dark Sea</em> to David Maslanka's
            <em>Symphony No. 8</em>. I've also been fortunate enough to travel
            with the ensemble to Costa Rica, where we played alongside pre-
            college students, sharing experiences and traditions.
